## Intentions
What do I mean by over-engineered? 


## Development
Development has been going in conceptual stages since I was 16 in 2015, since then much has changed with web tech stacks and I've adapted by going for a overkill method of building my personal startpage, I chose to use Vue over React for the main reason of I don't believe in allowing Facebook that much power over the internet but also because the frameworks for it at my start time were fairly lacking in automated features. Out of the Vue frameworks I investigated the best was ViteJS by a long shot for its great auto-set-up environment. After some time learning Vue and Vite in unison, I discovered my framework of choice: NuxtJS. After building some test apps in it, I went along to migrate my current startpage I had built in Vite to NuxtV2 and subsequently V3. One of the more valuable features of using nuxt for my over-engineered vision of a startpage, was the ability to generate my build to a static deployment target, meaning I don't have to use pm2 and Node to host my project on my server, instead I use Apache and Github Actions to Contiously Deploy to my website directory with my latest commit information.
